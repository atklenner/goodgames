A simple CRUD project for 100 Devs.
Uses Node, Express, MongoDB, EJS, and Bulma CSS.

Potential features:
- Friends, or a better way for users to communicate and share recommendations
- Average score for each game based on the review scores
- Provide a game description and screen shots for every game
- Figure out a better way to sort lists so users can use them for recommendations based on genre/developer/some other metric
- Filter games by publisher and develope 
- Dark theme, there are some solutions for this but none of them are very good, would require a rewrite of the Bulma framework and I Am Not Going To Do That
- URL Slugs for the games
- track when a user has finished a game and tally up all the games they have finished in the year, let them set a goal for games played
- add pagination to lists, games, reviews to make viewing easier/loading faster

# GoodGames

Think GoodReads but for video games. Users can create lists to track the games they are playing or want to play and review them as well.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** EJS, Bulma, Sass, Node, Express, MongoDB

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
