A simple CRUD project for 100 Devs.
Uses Node, Express, MongoDB, EJS, and Bulma CSS.

Potential features:
- Friends, or a better way for users to communicate and share recommendations
- Average score for each game based on the review scores
- Provide a game description and screen shots for every game
- Figure out a better way to sort lists so users can use them for recommendations based on genre/developer/some other metric
- Filter games by publisher and develope 
- Dark theme, there are some solutions for this but none of them are very good, would require a rewrite of the Bulma framework and I Am Not Going To Do That
