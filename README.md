# GoodGames

Think GoodReads but for video games. Users can create lists to track the games they are playing or want to play and review them as well. There is also a user editable database of video games so if anyone wants to keep track of a game they can add it themselves.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** EJS, Bulma, Sass, Node, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose

This application is server side rendered using Express running in Node with EJS as a templating language. I used MongoDB to store all my data and took advantage of the MongoDB Atlas Search to search for games by name, developer, or publisher. All of the UI styling comes from the Bulma CSS framework.

## Optimizations

When I come back to this project I would add more features like an average review score for games, more ways to filter games, and a counter that tracks the number of games played in a year so users can set a goal for themselves.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to separate my server code into logical chunks using MVC and how much it pays off in the long run to spend some time planning and organizing my project.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
